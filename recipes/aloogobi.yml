    title: Prep your vegetables
    instructions:
      - Wash and dry all produce. Cut your cauliflower into florets about 1-2 inches big. Dice your potatoes into similar sized cubes or chunks. Destem and slit green chili lengthwise, and remove the seeds.
    tips:
      - Cutting your cauliflower and potatoes into similar size pieces will help with even cooking and easy eating.
      - If you have a spicier palate, dice green chili small and keep the seeds in.

    title: Temper spices and aromatics
    instructions:
      - Heat a nonstick skillet or heavy bottomed pan over medium heat and add 3 tbsp oil. Once the oil is hot, about 2-3 minutes, add cumin seeds and green chili. Let them cook for a few seconds, until they sizzle.
      - Add chopped onions and a pinch of salt. Cook until the onions are slightly browned, stirring to prevent sticking or burning, about 5-7 minutes.
    tips:
      - Signs that your oil is hot:<br /><ul><li>it flows smoothly, quickly coating the pan.</li><li>the surface glistens and shimmers.</li><li>a small piece of food sizzles immediately when added to the pan.</li></ul>

    title: Cook potatoes and cauliflower
    instructions:
      - Add potatoes and cauliflower to the skillet and saute for 5 minutes until slightly softened.
      - Turn the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for an additional 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. The potatoes should be tender but not soggy.
    tips:
      - The vegetables should cook in their own juices. If you feel they are sticking to the pan, add only a bit of water to prevent burning.

    title: Finish the Aloo Gobi
    instructions:
      - Once fully cooked (there should be a little resistence when you try to break a potato), turn the heat off. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves.
      - Adjust for salt if necessary and add a squeeze of lemon for extra tang and freshness. Serve hot!
    tips: 
      - If the vegetables are cooked to your preference and you still see moisture pooling, raise the heat to medium and cook (covered) until it reaches your preferred consistency.
