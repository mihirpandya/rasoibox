    title: Cook potatoes and cauliflower
    instructions:
      - Add diced potatoes and cauliflower chunks.
      - Add salt to taste (about 1-2 tsp), mix well, and cover. Reduce the heat to low and cook the vegetables, mixing occasionally (every 3 minutes).
      - After 7-8 minutes, check the doneness of the vegetables. If they are still raw, add 1/4 cup of water, mix, and cover. Continue cooking for another 5 minutes.
    tips:
      - Your vegetables should be less than fork-tender at this stage. This means, if you are mostly able to poke a fork through the veggies, you are all set. You may face a little resistance, but don't worry, they will be cooked longer.
