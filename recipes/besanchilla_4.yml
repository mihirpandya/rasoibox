    title: flip the chilla
    instructions:
      - Cook the chilla on a low flame until the top begins to look cooked. It will turn from glossy to matte and you will start to see some bubbles form.
      - Drizzle oil around the edges of the chilla and continue cooking until the base gets light golden. Flip the chilla and cook the other side until golden spots appear. 
      - Add shredded paneer to one side of the chilla. Fold in half and serve hot or warm.
