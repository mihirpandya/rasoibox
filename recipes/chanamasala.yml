    title: temper spices and aromatics
    instructions:
      - Heat a large skillet or pot over medium heat and add 3 tbsp oil.
      - Once the oil is hot, about 2-3 minutes, add cumin seeds, bay leaves, and green chili. Let them cook for a few seconds, until they sizzle.
      - Add chopped onions and a pinch of salt. Cook until the onions are slightly browned, stirring to prevent sticking or burning, about 5-7 minutes.

    chefs_hats:
      - Put your chef hat on! Like your gravy thin? Add water! Thicker? Simmer uncovered for 5 min.<br /><br />Eat with roti, paratha, or naan, or over rice. You can also wrap in a flaky paratha for an on-the-go meal.
