    title: Temper spices and aromatics
    instructions:
      - Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 2 tbsp oil.
      - Once the oil is hot, about 2-3 minutes, add cumin seeds and asafoetida. Let them cook for a few seconds, until the cumin seeds sizzle and asafoetida froths. 
      - Add sliced onions and a pinch of salt. Saute until the onion turns light brown, stirring to prevent sticking or burning, about X minutes.
      - Stir in ginger-garlic paste and sauté for 2 minutes.
    tips:
      - Signs that your oil is hot:<br /><ul><li>it flows smoothly, quickly coating the pan.</li><li>the surface glistens and shimmers.</li><li>a small piece of food sizzles immediately when added to the pan.</li></ul>

    title: Cook the masala sauce
    instructions:
      - After stirring for about 2 minutes, mix in the tawa masala spice blend (turmeric, cumin-coriander powder, garam masala). Sauté for 30 seconds.
      - Stir in the tomato paste and tomato slices. Continue sautéing for about 4-5 mins until the oil separates.
      - Add 1/2 cup water and stir to combine.
    tips: 
      - Many flavor compounds found in spices are fat-soluble. By heating spices or herbs in fat (oil) prior to adding water, you will extract more flavor than you could by simply simmering these ingredients in water.
