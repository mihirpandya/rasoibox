    instructions:
      - Heat 4 tbsp oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat.
      - Once the oil is hot (about 2-3 minutes), add cumin seeds, bay leaves, and green chili. Sauté briefly, until they sizzle.

    title: Build the sauce
    instructions:
      - Stir in the tomato paste and red chili powder. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the paste is brick red and starts to caramelize. Add a splash of water to prevent sticking, if necessary.
      - Add heavy cream, garam masala, and fenugreek leaves. Stir thoroughly until combined. Season with salt and pepper and remove from heat.
    tips:
      - To fully unleash the aroma and flavor of fenugreek leaves, gently crush them between your palms before adding.
